      This is an Ethernet network for devices in 192.168.1.xx, 192.168.5.xx.
      All these IPs are considered to be part of the same Ethernet network and can *directly*
      address each other (possibly via a router or switch).

      This is another Ethernet network for devices in 10.xx.xx.xx.
      This network is not *directly* accessible from ENet1 (if it was it could be merged with ENet1).
